## Limitations

- [ ] Newly created documents locally are not synched. New documents must be added via webapp.
- [ ] Remotely renamed or restructured documents are synched, but old documents remain locally and must be deleted manually.
- [ ] Conflicts are not merged but needs to be resolved manually. Both conflicting files are kept for this.
